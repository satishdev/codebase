<promo>The Bear Course at the Okanagan Golf Club was designed to ignite your passion for the game of golf. Planned by Nicklaus Designs and built in 1998, The Bear is an 18-hole, 6,900 yard, par 72 masterpiece unlike any other golf course in British Columbia. With dramatic sculpted fairways surrounded by the forests and sage brush hills of B.C.`s sun-drenched southern interior, The Bear is the crown jewel course of the Okanagan Valley.</promo>
